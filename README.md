Pizza Sales Report Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Pizza Sales Report Dashboard, developed using Power BI and PostgreSQL. The goal was to analyze and visualize key sales metrics, providing insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and overall business performance.
Project Workflow

    Data Preparation:
        The data was initially uploaded into a SQL Server database, where it was organized and structured for analysis.

    Data Querying:
        SQL queries were written within SQL Server to extract relevant information needed for the analysis. These queries were designed to answer specific business questions related to sales performance.

    Data Import into Power BI:
        The queried data from SQL Server was imported into Power BI. This allowed for seamless integration of the data into the visualization process.

    Dashboard Creation:
        An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI. The dashboard includes various visualizations that highlight important sales metrics, such as total sales, sales by product type, sales by location, and customer demographics.

Key Features

    Dynamic Visualizations: The dashboard provides dynamic visualizations that can be filtered and drilled down for deeper insights.
    User-Friendly Interface: The design focuses on ease of use, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    Comprehensive Analysis: The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales performance, aiding in strategic decision-making.

Technologies Used

    Power BI: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
    PostgreSQL: For data storage and querying.
    SQL Server: For managing and querying the sales data before importing it into Power BI.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining SQL Server for data management with Power BI for data visualization. The interactive dashboard created here offers valuable insights into pizza sales, helping businesses make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
